After taking the time to reflect on the class, I've really enjoyed my time here. I can’t always say it’s an easy class, but my classmates and the Discord we created make me feel like I have more help than just trying to understand everything on my own. Coding is still very hard for me, and I’m far from mastering it, but having a great, energetic teacher and cool classmates who are also trying to help each other out while learning makes the experience great. I’m still worried about taking tests in the data science class because there are a lot of terms you need to know to do the work we do, but overall, I enjoy the class. After taking the class, it has influenced me to see not only computers but technology in an entirely new light. I think what I enjoyed the most in the class was the "Make Your Own Adventure" game because it brought out my creative side and also helped me understand more about coding.
